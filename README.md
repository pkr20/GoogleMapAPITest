i used coogle gloud place photos api to render 360 street view or panoramic photos for given location through html

1. perspective function, takes 3 different headings (povs) for one photo by looping through the same location variable 3 times and changing the heading thrice
2. download images function, takes the images rendered through html and names them by variables location and identification
